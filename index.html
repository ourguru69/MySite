                The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science,
                music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
                pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be
                desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have
                uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the
                resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common
                language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as
                Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English,
                as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is.The European languages are members of

                But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
                and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
                ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
                right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
                who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
                indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
                so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee.
